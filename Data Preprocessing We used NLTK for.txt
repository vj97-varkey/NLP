Data Preprocessing: We used NLTK for tokenization and stopwords removal, which helps reduce noise in the dataset and improves model performance.

Feature Extraction: TfidfVectorizer was chosen over CountVectorizer as it considers both word frequency and importance, which is crucial for text classification tasks.

Model Development: We implemented Naive Bayes and SVM models, which are suitable for text classification tasks. Naive Bayes is good for handling sparse data and works well with TF-IDF features, while SVM can handle complex decision boundaries.

Model Comparison: We evaluated both models using accuracy and F1-score metrics, providing a comprehensive comparison of their performance.
Best practices followed:

Splitting the data into training and test sets for proper evaluation
Using appropriate preprocessing techniques to clean the text data
Employing feature extraction methods tailored to text data
Comparing multiple models to determine the most suitable one for the task
To further improve the models, consider experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or more advanced deep learning architectures like LSTM networks. Additionally, exploring domain-specific resources or fine-tuning pre-trained language models could lead to better performance for emotion classification tasks.
